# Changelog

All notable Doctrine release changes live here.
This file is the portable release history. `docs/VERSIONING.md` is the
evergreen policy guide.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

Use this section for work that is not public yet.

When you cut a public release:

1. Copy the release entry template below.
2. Replace the placeholders.
3. Move the real change notes into the new release section.
4. Leave `## Unreleased` at the top for the next cycle.

Public release entries must replace every placeholder before `make release-tag`
or `make release-draft` runs. The helper rejects placeholder compatibility
payload text and breaking releases with no real upgrade steps.
